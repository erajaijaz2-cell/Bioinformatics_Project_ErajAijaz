Summary:This bioinformatics analysis demonstrates that the studied protein is a highly conserved, non-enzymatic regulatory factor involved in the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway. Sequence and domain analyses revealed extensive intrinsically disordered regions, supporting a role in flexible protein–protein and RNA interactions. Subcellular localization predictions indicate a cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, consistent with its function in mRNA surveillance. Phylogenetic analysis showed strong conservation across vertebrate species, highlighting its evolutionary importance. Interaction network analysis further confirmed its integration within the core NMD machinery, emphasizing its critical role in maintaining mRNA quality control and cellular homeostasis.
